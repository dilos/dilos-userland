   Sun Fire X4500s. This fix is expected to be delivered back to Sourceforge

   		gpatch -p0 < ipmitool.scanning.patch

2. ipmievd.local4.patch - fix to allow ipmievd to automatically start
   logging events to syslog "out of the box" instead of having to edit
   /etc/syslog.conf with the following line to allow logging of events:

	       	local4.info                      /var/adm/messages

#The libevent that is bundled with Solaris is a trimed down version.
#It does not contain the evhttp*, evdns* functions. The man page 'event.3'
#is patched to remove descriptions regarding these functions.
#
#The original manpage is in a format that the Solaris man command does
#not understand. Hence it has been manually converted.

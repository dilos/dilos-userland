.SH NAME
SblimCimClient - A Java implementation of a WBEM services client that includes an IETF RFC 2614 compliant SLP client for CIM service discovery.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B add sblim jars to the CLASSPATH

.SH DESCRIPTION
SBLIM is an acronym for Standards Based Linux Instrumentation for Manageability. The goal of this project is to Provide a complete Open Source implementation of a WBEM-based management solution for Linux. The SBLIM CIM Client for Java is an implementation of a WBEM services client that includes an IETF RFC 2614 compliant SLP client for CIM service discovery. It is intended to be used by management applications in all areas that leverage CIM technology such as SMI-S, SMASH, etc. The design of the SBLIM Client has put emphasis on low memory consumption and high performance. It offers different options to use the implemented XML parser (SAX, DOM, Pull). Furthermore, a comfortable way to debug interoperability issues by dumping the XML request and response to a log file is provided.
